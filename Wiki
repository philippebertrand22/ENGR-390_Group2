      Getting the ESP32 to work
      
I decided to get it working using VScode because it offers more functionalities. 
I feel it is important for future projects/career. 
This means using C

ESP32 comes from a Chinesse company called Espressif


You need do a couple things:

1. Drivers just so that your computer recognizes the ESP32. Had to do device manager/right click on the device that wasn't recognized/update driver and manually direct it to the files I downloaded:

2. In VScode install the following extensions:
-Espressif IDF
-Python (if you do Terminal/New Terminal and write python, I still had to install python from the microsoft store. Worked after that)

3. Follow this guide to get a basic blink example to work. 
Used ESP32 Chip (Via ESP USB Bridge) and UART to flash
